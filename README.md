# Rolsa Technologies Backend
A basic backend written in Python with FastAPI for an exam. Unfortuantely due to network restrictions, setting up SQL databases for testing wasn't possible so all data is stored in JSON files. <br />
When hosting the website, the backend must be run on port 8002 to work properly with the frontend.
